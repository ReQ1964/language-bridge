# Language Bridge

<a href="https://language-bridge.vercel.app/">LIVE DEMO</a>

This platform is in its early phase, where the main focus has been on experimenting with various libraries and integrating them. I was exploring Next.js pages router features, with testing carried out using Vitest. The design was put together using AntDesign components, along with styled-components and Storybook integration, further served for Vitest. Husky has been implemented, which covers pre-commit linting, prettier formatting, and tests. Form validation for the sign-up process has been implemented using React-hook-form in conjunction with yup. Additionally, data such as reviews, articles, and pricing options are retrieved via a REST API, leveraging Firebase.
